# Small_Scale_Dataset_Evaluation
Small Scale ECG Evaluation An end-to-end machine learning pipeline for processing ECG signals. This project handles raw data ingestion (WFDB), signal normalization, and sliding-window segmentation to train a Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Currently configured as a small-scale prototype for pipeline validation.
